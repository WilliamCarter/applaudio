Frontend
--------
- Update Grunt build with minification, concatenation and other optimisations. SASS maps?
- Music player component.
- Track queue component.
- Auto resizing header.
- Handle animations better when adding a directory that already exists. Smooth scroll and highlight?
- Create a modal queue, to allow modals to be able to throw alerts/dialogs for errors.
- Status bar

Backend
-------
- Redesign data model.
  - Use a database for all metadata.
  - Reference music files by key, not by their actual location. This is dangerous!
- Investigate file upload security.
