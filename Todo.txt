Frontend
--------
- Update Grunt build with minification, concatenation and other optimisations. SASS maps? SASS watch task?
- Music player component.
- Track queue component.
- Auto resizing header.
- Handle animations better when adding a directory that already exists. Smooth scroll and highlight?
- Move directory download to within a directory.

Backend
-------
- Redesign data model.
  - Use a database for all metadata.
  - Reference music files by key, not by their actual location. This is dangerous!
- Investigate file upload security. Accept only certain types of file.
