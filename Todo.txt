Frontend
--------
- Fade in auto scrolling label.
- Delete file/directory.
- Auto resizing header.
- Handle animations better when adding a directory that already exists. Smooth scroll and highlight?

Backend
-------
- Redesign data model.
  - Use a database for all metadata.
  - Reference music files by key, not by their actual location. This is dangerous!
- Investigate file upload security. Accept only certain types of file.


Bugs
----
Cannot create directory with '/', '?' in the name.
